# Job Portal Smart Contract

# DESCRIPTION

Unskilled migrant workers face a major issue due to a lack of awareness of the available jobs and a lack of platforms that list them. They cannot register and apply for the job that best matches their skills through such platforms. Due to this, middlemen such as job agencies and contractors connect these workers to jobs through illegal means and ask for a major portion of their salary as commissions. 

# Solution 

Develop a Dapp using Blockchain technology that connects unskilled and unorganized migrant workers with job providers. It can eliminate their exploitation by middlemen, such as unrecognized agents and contractors. A worker can register with the portal by creating their profile and uploading labor history, skills, availability, and other personal details. Then, a job provider can directly connect with the worker.â€¯ 

# Advantages 

Experience building through building a job history and rating mechanism of laborers. 

Migrant laborers can show this experience in a resume or CV when they apply for any job. 

Our aim is to allow laborers to rise up the social ladder through this process of experience building.
